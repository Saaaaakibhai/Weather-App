# Weather App

This project was developed for the interview session at NexKraft. It is built using Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend. However, due to some issues with Angular, the frontend is now implemented using Thymeleaf.

The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays the current weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
